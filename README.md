#### [Harmony](https://harmonysocial.herokuapp.com/) is a platform that allows users to easily share music and start conversations about the songs they're listening to 

## Features 👀

## 🔮 Future features 🔮

##  💻 Tech Used 💻

 These are the different technologies we are incorporating (MERN stack)

> - React.js ⚛  
> - Express.js 🚄 
> - MongoDB Atlas 💪
> - Mongoose 🐀
